# Fast-Food-E-commerce-website-React.js

A Fast-Food-E-commerce I created for the sake of practicing React and Redux toolkit . It features design 
patterns recommended by the documentation. Some of the tools used include: <br />

* Hooks (and custom hooks)
* React Router
* @material-ui/core
* firebase
* axios
* framer-motion
* react-router-dom
* react-hook-form
* react-intersection-observer
* react-multi-carousel

It is a work in progress. Any tips on how to better write the code, manage the folder structure, etc would be really appreciated. <br />

The future of this project: <br />

* Create an authentication flow by useing firebase . 
* create 7 pages (Home , About , login , register , shopping cart , our products , checkout ) .
* you could make add product to  shopping cart  , it stores at loacal storage .  
* you could filter products at our products page . 
* you could make order and the order data post to firebase storge .
